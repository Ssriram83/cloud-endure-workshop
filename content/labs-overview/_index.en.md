CloudEndure disaster recovery solution can be used to protect your on-premise or vcenter or any other cloud. Please choose a lab scenario based on your learning requirement:

- [**Cross Region Disaster Recovery**]({{< ref "/lab1" >}}):
 In this lab, we will be setting up a cross-region disaster recovery solution for a 2-tier LAMP Stack operation on AWS by using CloudEndure.

- [**On-Premise to Cloud Disaster Recovery**]({{< ref "/lab2" >}}): 
In this lab, we will be setting up CloudEndure Disaster Recovery for a 2-tier application running at your premise. In order to simulate a workload running on-premises, we will be using a software called <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/"> VirtualBox</a>. VirtualBox is a free and open source hosted hypervisor for x86 virtualization. 

- [**Vcenter to Cloud Disaster Recovery**]({{< ref "/lab3" >}}):
