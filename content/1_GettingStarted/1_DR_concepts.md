#### What is a Disaster?
Any event that prevents a workload or systems from fulfilling its business objectives in its primary deployed location is considered a disaster.

#### What is a Disaster Recovery?
Disaster recovery is the process of preparing for and recovering from a disaster.

#### What are the categories of disaster that can impact production workloads?

When planning for disaster recovery, evaluate your plan for these three main categories of disaster:

* Natural disasters, such as earthquakes or floods
* Technical failures, such as power failure or network connectivity
* Human actions, such as inadvertent misconfiguration or unauthorized/outside party access or modification

Each of these potential disasters will also have a geographical impact that can be local, regional, country-wide, continental, or global


#### RPO & RTO

#### Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)

**Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** is the maximum acceptable amount of time since the last data recovery point. This objective determines what is considered an acceptable loss of data between the last recovery point and the interruption of service and is defined by the organization.

#### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

**Recovery Time Objective (RTO)** is the maximum acceptable delay between the interruption of service and restoration of service. This objective determines what is considered an acceptable time window when service is unavailable and is defined by the organization.

#### Failover

Failover refers to the process of recovering your workloads to the target infrastructure during a test or disaster.

#### Failback

Once you have recovered your primary site after a disaster and resolved any issues associated, you can transfer business operations back to the source Infrastructure. The actual steps for Failback depend on the source infrastructure. In case your source environment is AWS or VMWare, the steps are fully orchestrated. If your source infrastructure is physical or other public cloud providers, a Failback client would be necessary.

#### Disaster Recovery Options

Disaster recovery strategies can be broadly categorized into four approaches, ranging from the low cost and low complexity of making backups to more complex strategies using multiple active Regions.

CloudEndure Disaster Recovery uses the Pilot Light strategy, maintaining a copy of data and switched-off resources in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) used as a staging area. When a failover event is triggered, the staged resources are used to automatically create a full-capacity deployment in the target Amazon VPC used as the recovery location. Accordingly, CloudEndureâ€™s Disaster Recovery solution provides the resilience of a warm standby solution at the low cost of a cold standby solution.
