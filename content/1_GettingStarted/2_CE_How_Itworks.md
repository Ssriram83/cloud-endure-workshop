#### How CloudEndure Disaster Recovery Works

CloudEndure Disaster Recovery continuously replicates your machines (including operating system, system state configuration, databases, applications, and files) into a low-cost staging area in your target AWS account and preferred Region. In the case of a disaster, you can instruct CloudEndure Disaster Recovery to automatically launch thousands of your machines in their fully provisioned state in minutes.

Because the staging area does not run a live version of your workloads, you do not need to pay for duplicate software licenses or high-performance compute. In the event of a disaster, click a button in the CloudEndure User Console to launch up-to-date, fully operational workloads on AWS in minutes.
