Welcome to CloudEndure Disaster Recovery workshop!

CloudEndure Disaster Recovery solution is a solution that minimizes downtime and data loss by providing fast, reliable recovery of physical, virtual, and cloud-based servers into AWS.
You can use it to replicate commonly used databases, such as Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and MySQL, as well as enterprise applications such as SAP. Meet stringent recovery objectives and reduce disaster recovery total cost of ownership (TCO) with a single tool for your entire environment.

#### How CloudEndure Disaster Recovery Works
CloudEndure Disaster Recovery continuously replicates your machines (including operating system, system state configuration, databases, applications, and files) into a low-cost staging area in your target AWS account and preferred Region. In the case of a disaster, you can instruct CloudEndure Disaster Recovery to automatically launch thousands of your machines in their fully provisioned state in minutes.

Because the staging area does not run a live version of your workloads, you do not need to pay for duplicate software licenses or high-performance compute. In the event of a disaster, click a button in the CloudEndure User Console to launch up-to-date, fully operational workloads on AWS in minutes.
