CloudEndure Disaster Recovery solution provides fast, reliable recovery of physical, virtual, and cloud-based servers into AWS. You can use it to replicate commonly used databases, such as Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and MySQL, as well as enterprise applications such as SAP. 

In this workshop, we will learn how to set up Disaster Recovery for a fictional 2-tier web application running on AWS cloud. We will also see how the concepts that we learnt can be applied in setting up any other environments such as VMWare, physical Servers or other cloud-based servers.
