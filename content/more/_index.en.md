### Use CloudEndure for other types of Environment

Most of the process that we saw in this workshop is consistent and can be followed in other source environments as well. We have provided links on how you can go about for these sources. 

- [Other Targets](https://docs.cloudendure.com/#Other_Targets/Other_Targets.htm) For  other cloud or non-cloud infrastructures, we would be using `failback client` to perform the failback process.

- [vCenter as Source](https://docs.cloudendure.com/#Configuring_and_Running_Disaster_Recovery/Using_Disaster_Recovery_with_vCenter/Using_Disaster_Recovery_with_vCenter.htm) CloudEndure vCemter appliance can be installed to perform a fully orchestrated failover and failback for environments running vCenter 6.5 and 6.7.
