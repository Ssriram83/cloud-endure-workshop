### Use CloudEndure for other types of environments

Most of the process that we saw in this workshop can be followed in other types of source environments as well. We have provided links on how you can implement CloudEndure Disaster Recovery solution for other sources. 

- [Other Targets](https://docs.cloudendure.com/#Other_Targets/Other_Targets.htm) - This link details the process to be followed for  other cloud or non-cloud infrastructures. The primary difference in the process Vs what was projected in the workshop is that, for "other sources" we would be installing `failback client` at the source machines to perform the failback process.

- [vCenter as Source](https://docs.cloudendure.com/#Configuring_and_Running_Disaster_Recovery/Using_Disaster_Recovery_with_vCenter/Using_Disaster_Recovery_with_vCenter.htm) - The CloudEndure vCenter appliance can be installed to perform a fully orchestrated failover and failback for environments running vCenter 6.5 and 6.7.
