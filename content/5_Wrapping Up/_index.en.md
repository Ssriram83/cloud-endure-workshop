Congratulations for making this far!

Hereâ€™s a reminder of everything we accomplished. 

We:
1. Setup a CloudEndure Disaster Recovery project and Replication. 
2. Learnt how to **Install CloudEndure Agents** on a Source machine.
3. Understood how to **Configure Blueprint** for your recovered servers.
4. Learnt how to do a DR test drills. 
5. How to initiate Failover and Failback during an actual disaster.

Please give yourself a **huge pat on the back** for making it all the way to the end!

Now, lets see how you can use what we learnt in other situations.
